By default, Docker containers run as root, which means that if an attacker manages to break out of the container, they would have root access to the host system. This is a serious security concern as it can lead to unauthorized access and control over the host system.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to always run your Docker containers as a non-root user. This can be achieved by creating a new user in your Dockerfile and switching to this user before executing any commands.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a fix for the provided Dockerfile:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM golang:1.16-alpine3.13 as build\n\n# Create a new user 'nonroot'\nRUN adduser -D nonroot\n\n# Switch to the new user\nUSER nonroot\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the Docker container runs as the 'nonroot' user, significantly reducing the risk of a successful attack.\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/250.html)\n\nPlease note that the links provided are active and accessible to anonymous users at the time of writing this report."

This is a high-risk vulnerability known as \"Lack of Non-Root User Specification\". If an attacker manages to break out from the container, they could gain root access to the Docker host.\n\n## Security Concern\n\nRunning a Docker container as root poses a significant security risk. If an attacker manages to exploit a vulnerability in the container or the application it's running, they could gain root access to the host system. This would give them full control over the system, allowing them to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or perform other malicious activities.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should always specify a non-root user to run the container. This can be done by adding a `USER` directive in the Dockerfile. If the application needs to perform operations that require root privileges, consider using a least privilege approach where only the necessary operations are allowed.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere's how you can modify the Dockerfile to specify a non-root user:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM golang:1.14 as build\n\n# Create a non-root user 'nonroot' and switch to it\nRUN useradd -m nonroot\nUSER nonroot\n```\n\nIn this example, a new user named 'nonroot' is created and the `USER` directive is used to switch to this user. Now, the container will run with the privileges of the 'nonroot' user, significantly reducing the risk of a successful attack.\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/250.html)"
